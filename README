                      The Open Deduction Graphical Proof Editor

Installation:
=============
There is an executable jar file named `OpenDeductionProofEditor.jar',
it can be executed by invoking 'java - jar OpenDeductionProofEditor.jar'
This supports the Linux operating system.

A jar file for the OSX operating system has been included (but has not been tested).
In the case of using OSX, 'java -jar OpenDeductionProofEditor-OSX' must be invoked.

The source code is in the file 'src'.

The system is an adaption of the graphical proof editor GraPE by Max Schaefer,
which was created to work with the calculus of structures. The inference systems
that are implemented into Maude at the backend are adapted and derived from
Ozan Kahramanogullari's implementations [http://ozan-k.com/].

An inference system must have:
- A maude file e.g. 'ksg.maude'
- A xml file e.g. 'ksg-maude.xml'

All files within the directory are important to run the software.

Operating System
================
The Open Deduction Graphical Proof Editor currently supports the Linux operating
system, and the OSX operating system (not tested).

The source files for both operating systems are included for the user to compile
and run the code themselves.

The main difference lies in how Maude is executed:
- The file Maude.linux64 is used with Linux
- The file Maude.darwin64 is used with OSX

The Maude file must be executable for the proof editor to function.

*** line 34 of Maude.java is where './maude.linux64' or '/maude.darwin64' is defined
*** and is where Maude is executed from for the backend of the proof editor
